      <h3 id="About">About Me</h3>
      <p>My name is Guilherme Vecchi and I am studying at Lambda School to be a full-stack developer. I am expected to graduate in August 2021. I have completed 2 years of Computer Science at Utah Valley University, before deciding to focus on Web development and embarking my journey with Lambdaâ€™s coding bootcamp.

        For the last couple of years, I have had the opportunity to work in various customer service positions. I have been able to develop customer care and bedside manners. I have also developed technical skills and a passion for learning through school. I enjoy working with technology and helping others resolve their problems. 
        
        I currently work as a Business Analyst at Doterra. As a Business Analyst I have learned to hear the needs of the customers and markets and transform this into projects for our developers to bring to life. I have also learned to troubleshoot and run tests for our systems. 
        
        These are all skills that will help me as I begin developing my own projects. Understanding the business needs are crucial for a successful developer.
